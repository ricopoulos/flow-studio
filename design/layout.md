## Layout Rationale

### Why This Structure?
1. **Hero-first approach:** Immediate value communication, standard for SaaS/product landing pages
2. **Value props early:** Visitors need quick reasons to stay (Section 2)
3. **Education middle:** Once interested, show how it works (Sections 3-4)
4. **Proof through demonstration:** Meta-example builds trust (Section 5)
5. **Developer appeal:** Technical details for decision-makers (Section 6)
6. **Strong CTA:** Clear next step before footer (Section 7)

### Content Hierarchy
- **H1:** Hero headline (one per page)
- **H2:** Section headings (8 total)
- **H3:** Card/feature titles within sections
- **Body:** 16px, line-height 1.6 for readability

### Mobile Strategy
- Stack all multi-column layouts
- Reduce vertical padding by ~33%
- Maintain button sizes (48px minimum for touch targets)
- Hero height: 60vh on mobile (vs 80-90vh desktop)

### Accessibility Considerations
- Logical heading order (no skipped levels)
- Alt text for all visuals (to be added by Builder)
- Form inputs with visible labels (if forms added)
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Minimum 44×44px touch targets on mobile

---

## Next Steps for Stylist
- Generate `tokens.json` based on DESIGN-ENGINE.md
- Ensure color contrast validation
- Define component-specific tokens (card, button, etc.)
- Prepare CSS custom properties for Builder

---

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- **Imagery:** Using placeholders or CDN links? (Assume CDN placeholders for now)
- **Icons:** Inline SVG or icon font? (Recommend inline SVG for accessibility)
- **Animations:** Hover states only, or entrance animations? (Recommend hover only, respect prefers-reduced-motion)
